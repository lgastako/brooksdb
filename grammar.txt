For right now we are trying to parse the simplest of variable
declarations, specifically one with no value even, e.g:

    VAR x

We want to wind up emitting something like this for that:

    VarDec (String "x")

Give or take.

We want to go through our Alex based lexer first, where it
should recognize "VAR" and emit it as a token, then swallow
the whitespace and emit "x" as VarName or similar.
